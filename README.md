# Ryzentosh OpenCore files 

//TODO: Finish documenting. In the meanwhile, enlightened being on the Internet, I'm sorry. 

## How do I use this?
Make sure you've read the entire OpenCore documentation once, just to make sure you understand what you're doing. Once that's done, grab the files in this repository and copy them to the EFI folder (or EFI partition, depending on how you set it up). The config file has already been patched for the following setup: 

* CPU: * Ryzen 5 3600 (must work for all Ryzens, not for Threadrippers, Bulldozers or EPYC processors)
* GPU: * GT710 (DDR5, 2GB)
* Motherboard: * ASUS A320M EX Gaming (must work for all 1st gen Ryzen boards).
